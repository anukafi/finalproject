#Motivation: 
##Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.
The motivation of this project is to use the Yelp dataset to look for trends in highly rated restaurants in Las Vegas. Our goal is to use the data to generate relevant insights that can be used to inform restaurant goers through dynamic visualizations to help answer the age-old question, "I don't know, what are you in the mood for eating tonight?".

#Related work: 
##Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.
Yelp inspired us to explore data regarding restaurants as it is commonly used on a daily basis to check out local restaurants for a wide-range of information and reviews. 
We were also inspired by the map created in class using the AirBnB data that used the latitudes and longitudes, thus found a dataset that included such thing so we would be able to create a similar 
map for restaurants in Las Vegas. 

#Initial questions: 
##What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
We are trying to answer questions about restaurant information and ratings for different neighborhoods in Las Vegas. 

#Data: 
##Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.
The source of the data:  [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) is a well known website that allows users to review and rate restaurants they've been to, so that this knowledge can be shared with others. Yelp users, or "Yelpers" have written over 163 million reviews since the website's inception in 2014, with 32 million unique users every month. This dataset was released for academic use, and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/version/6) on Kaggle.com. [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an online community of data scientists, owned by [Google](https://www.google.com/about/), and Yelp posted these csv files to Kaggle.com as a user.
