### **General Project Information**

* A full report of this analysis can be found [here](Report.html). 

* The repo is for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/anukafi/finalproject.github.io.git).

* This analysis uses data from Yelp.com. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/version/6), but since these files were very large, we filtered to find only datapoints in Las Vegas.

### **Analysis Summary**

#### *Project Scope*
The motivation of this project is to answer the age-old question, "I don't know, what are you in the mood to eat tonight?". Using data from Las Vegas, we focus on investigating star ratings, food categories, and neighborhoods.

#### *Data* 
The source of the data- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)- is a well known website that allows users to review and rate restaurants they've been to, so that this knowledge can be shared with others. Yelp users, or "Yelpers" have written over 163 million reviews since the website's inception in 2014, with 32 million unique users every month.

#### *Approaches*
We performed exploratory statistical analysis in order to look into this dataset. Originally the dataset contained information for all types of businesses, so we narrowed it to just restaurants in Las Vegas. We were able to look at restaurant information by neighborhood and category type too. We used ANOVA to see if if there was homogeneity in star ratings by food category and neighborhood.

#### *Visualizations*
We included 3 plots with our analysis, located on our Flexdashboard. The first graph displays the number of restaurants in each category by neighborhood. The second two plots look at the geographical distribution of restaurants based on their star rating, and based on their restaurant category. These plots helped us to visually assessed whether or not there was clustering of ratings or categories based on location.

#### *Results*
There were 3476 restaurants included in our analysis, 11 food categories, and 16 neighborhoods. We found that star ratings significantly differed both by neighborhood (p-value < 0.05) and by restaurant category (p-value < 0.05). Detailed results can be found in our project report.
