### **General Project Information**

* A full report of this analysis can be found [here](Report.html). 

* The repo is for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/anukafi/finalproject.github.io.git).

* This analysis uses data from Yelp.com. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/version/6), but since these files were very large, we filtered to find only datapoints in Las Vegas. The subset used in this analysis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pv1kB8oF7DLqWeWaSoDqLAMhqVHLMOqu?usp=sharing).

### **Analysis Summary**

#### *Project Scope*
Using data from Las Vegas, we focused on investigating star ratings, food categories, and neighborhoods to answer the age-old question, "I don't know, what are you in the mood to eat tonight?". 

#### *Data* 
The source of the data, [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), is a well known website that allows users to review and rate restaurants they've visited to share with others. Yelp users, or "Yelpers", have written over 163 million reviews since the website's inception in 2014, with 32 million unique users every month.

#### *Approaches*
First, we subsetted the original dataset to narrow our data points down to include only Las Vegas restaurants. Using this subset, we performed exploratory statistical analyses. Next, we created data summaries (tables and visualizations) to look at restaurant information by neighborhood and category type. Finally, we used ANOVA tests to see if if there was homogeneity in star ratings by food category and neighborhood.

#### *Visualizations*
We included 3 plots with our analysis, located on our Flexdashboard. The first graph displays the number of restaurants in each category by neighborhood. The second two plots look at the geographical distribution of restaurants based on their star rating, and based on their restaurant category. These plots helped us to visually assessed whether or not there was clustering of ratings or categories based on location.

#### *Results*
There were 3476 restaurants included in our analysis, 11 food categories, and 16 neighborhoods. We found that star ratings significantly differed both by neighborhood (p-value < 0.05) and by restaurant category (p-value < 0.05). Detailed results can be found in our project report.
